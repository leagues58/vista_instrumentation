				     <h2><span>BNSF - Vista Instrumentation GPS comparison</span></h2>
				     <p>In January 2012, a Vista Instrumentation geometry system was used to record BNSF track from Newton to Emporia Kansas.  The same track was recorded with BNSF Car 80 about one month earlier.
                    The GPS data is overlaid in the map below with BNSF data shown in red and the Vista Instrumentation data in green.  The Vista trace is approximately 15 feet off the track centerline.
                    However, this offset could result from the map data or the plotting program.  The consistent offset of the two traces suggests that map generation is a significant factor.
                    The only conclusion which can be made is that the Vista Instrumentation data is comparable to data from BNSF Car 80.</p>
